# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?

# GitHub is a remote repository that acts kind of like a cloud for codes and scripts when people can collaborate on and copy each other's work. Git Bash is a terminal that uses the bash language. Git is a system that allows you to manage code in local and remote repositories.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?

# The command line is where you use the shell language to navigate directories, folders, and files. The terminal is an interface that relays the commands to the computer.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?

#Powershell uses a different shell language than Git Bash.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?

#Python is a programming language. Anaconda is where you can find packages for Python programming. Conda manages such packages.

# 5) What is VS Code?

#VS Code is an application where you can create and edit Python scripts.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?

# Jupyter Notebook is similar to VS code with more extensible features. Jupyter Lab on the other hand is essentially the next generation of Jupyter Notebook.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?

# ~/ indicates that the following directory is the root directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?

# An absolute path explicates all directories that lead to a file or folder. A relative path only explicates relevant directories like the current parent directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".

# ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2

#../../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?

# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)

# It would remove the current directory.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add - add files and folders to the staging area
# git commit - commit saves of the files and folders to the local repository
# git push - saves changes to the local repository in a remote repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?

# git add . adds all files. git add <file> specifies a file to add.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?

#git status shows the current branch, saves to be commited and untracked files.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?

# Cloning a repository adds a remote repository to your local device. Pulling from a repository entails modifying the contents of a repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?

# The most annoying error is when it says the directory cannot be found or doesn't exist because I misspelled the directory. I usually fix the spelling the next time. Also, when a command is missing an option (which is kind of annoying) I use --help very frequently.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?

# I'm still quite confused about the options in a lot of the terminal commands. I'd like to know more.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!

# I lived in Nepal for 4 years.

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far.
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)

print(65%12) # returns the remainder of a division
